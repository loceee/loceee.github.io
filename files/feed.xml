That way I can track and nail down bugs, and fix the wonky bits of <a href="https://github.com/patchoo/patchoo/blob/master/docs/_index.md" rel="self">documentation</a>.<br /><br />And now on the the planned changes before I bounce it to <a href="https://github.com/patchoo/patchoo/issues?milestone=1&state=open" rel="self">0.99</a>.<br /><br />Just as I released it and <em>completed</em> the docs, I realised that one of my grumble points from an admin workflow was the fact we had to manually pass parameters to the --cache mode and tell the script which pkg was being cached.<br /><br />Can we remove this?<strong> Yes, we can</strong>!<br /><br /><code>ls -tr /Library/Application\ Support/JAMF/Waiting\ Room/ | tail -n 1 | grep -v .cache.xml</code><br /><br />We shouldn't be parsing ls I know.. this will return the newest pkg addition to the Waiting Room. If run directly after a pkg cache, and then we check against existing patchoo pkgdata metadata, this should be pretty robust way of locating what has been cached.. without telling the script directly.<br /><br />Now, how do we get a friendly name for UI? <br /><br />Then we just query the JSS, pull down the pkg info, then parse out the pkg info <a href="https://github.com/patchoo/patchoo/issues/3" rel="self">https://github.com/patchoo/patchoo/issues/3</a> <info>A friendly Name for your App 14.21</info> can be entered into the jss via Casper Admin as you import your packages!<br /><br />Now a pkg deployment / caching policy only requires that you add <code>0patchoo.sh --cache</code> and set it to <em>Run After </em>!<br /><br /><br /><br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>junki is now Patchoo&#x21;</title><dc:creator>Lachlan Stewart</dc:creator><dc:subject>home</dc:subject><dc:date>2014-05-19T10:54:23+10:00</dc:date><link>http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/junki-is-now-patchoo.html#unique-entry-id-1</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/junki-is-now-patchoo.html#unique-entry-id-1</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[The feedback on junki has been awesome. I am pretty amazed at how many people have checked it out and the kind words I've received!<br /><br />However, junki was always a working title. It seems it's caused a bit of <a href="https://twitter.com/ChipPearson/status/467331897522012160" rel="self">confusion</a> and I really don't want to step on the toes of the <a href="http://managingosx.wordpress.com" rel="self">Greg</a> and  the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/munki/" rel="self">munki</a> guys as I have the utmost respect for them.<br /><br />So after a sleep deprived weekend of madness with the kids, a new name came to me in a vision... <br /><br />...a weird 60s space vision... <br /><br />think Mars Attacks and kitsch sci-fi ray guns as you pronounce junki's new name...<br /><br /><h3><a href="http://patchoo.github.io/patchoo/" rel="external">Patchoo!</a></h3><br /><br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="Pasted Graphic" src="http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/pasted-graphic.jpg" width="609" height="293" /><br /><br />After a mad search and replace, a repo rename ... welcome <strong>Patchoo</strong> to it's new home: <a href="http://patchoo.github.io/patchoo/" rel="external">http://patchoo.github.io/patchoo/</a><br /><br />Excuse old references to junki in screenshots, but please do flag any you see. The discussion on JAMFnation is probably the best place to go to post issues, or git on Github and submit requests.<br /><br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hello junki</title><dc:creator>Lachlan Stewart</dc:creator><dc:subject>home</dc:subject><dc:date>2014-05-16T09:48:06+10:00</dc:date><link>http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/hello-junki.html#unique-entry-id-0</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/hello-junki.html#unique-entry-id-0</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<br /><br />I am officially releasing junki into the world! (It's about time!)<br /><br />Mac patching on Casper, DONE RIGHT! There are million and one ways to deploy software and patches via Casper, but I think I've built a pretty great workflow and user experience.<br /><br />In between countless tonnes of desktop support, broken meeting rooms and sleepless nights with my latest family addition, I have finally got the documentation (mostly) finished, and the code to a place where it's almost readable and (mostly) works.<br /><br />Head on over to it's new home on GitHub - <a href="http://munkiforjamf.github.io/junki/" rel="self">http://munkiforjamf.github.io/junki/</a><br /><br />Watch the video, and then read (and help improve) the documentation and code! Submit some requests and I will figure out how to drive GitHub.<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315"  src="http:///www.youtube.com/embed/aeOOPHH3-NY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Again, if you like it I encourage you to say thanks with a LinkedIn reach out, endorse me, or write a nice recommendation. If you are ever in sunny Queensland Australia, you can always buy me a beer too.<br /><br /><em>Enjoy junki responsibly.</em><br /><br /><br />]]></content:encoded></item></channel>
