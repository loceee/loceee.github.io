Mac OOTB<br />	2.	Setup Assistant<br />	3.	QuickAdd enroled via user or admin<br />	4.	User or admin can be prompted for the following provisioning information:<br />	<span style="font:12px &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, LucidaGrande, Verdana, sans-serif; ">◦</span>	ComputerName<br />	<span style="font:12px &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, LucidaGrande, Verdana, sans-serif; ">◦</span>	Custom Patchoo "Build" extension attribute (this can be used to scope, and fires a custom deploy-xxx trigger)<br />	<span style="font:12px &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, LucidaGrande, Verdana, sans-serif; ">◦</span>	Department<br />	<span style="font:12px &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, LucidaGrande, Verdana, sans-serif; ">◦</span>	Building<br />	5.	The JSS has provision details written.<br />	6.	A launchagent and bootstraphelper is written to drive the "bootstrap" process.<br />	7.	The Mac restarts<br />	8.	Bootstrap starts a loginwindow, the screen is locked.<br />	9.	Mac pulls provision information from the JSS.<br />	10.	Bootstraphelper fires -trigger deploy<br />	11.	All policies scoped to this trigger are run (scope geographic or department specific in this way).<br />	12.	Bootstraphelper fires -trigger deploy-xxxx (xxx being your build intentifier stored in the JSS ext attrib) - scope build specific policies.<br />	13.	Deploy process is finished.<br />	14.	Mac restarts and starts update loop.<br />	15.	A patchoo update session loops until Mac is fully patched.<br />	16.	Loginwindow unlocks.<br /><br />You can leverage, all some or none of the provisioning details. You can support admin or enduser enrolment and provisioning. Macs that are imaged via Casper Imaging or don't have provisioning information set go in to a "holdingpattern" and notify administrators.<br /><br /><br /><br />On enrollment complete trigger.<br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="pd_welcome" src="http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/pd_welcome.png" width="534" height="251" /><br /><br />Prompted to confirm and set computername<br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="pd_computername" src="http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/pd_computername.png" width="534" height="275" /><br /><br />If you change the computer name, the JSS is checked for an existing one.<br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="pd_computername_exists" src="http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/pd_computername_exists.png" width="534" height="234" /><br /><br />The Patchoo Build EA is read and prompted for.<br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="pd_select_build" src="http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/pd_select_build.png" width="366" height="362" /><br /><br />If no API user with write access is provided, an admin can choose the provisioning details and enter their credentials to save them to the JSS.<br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="pd_enter_admin" src="http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/pd_enter_admin.png" width="534" height="275" /><br /><br />The Mac restarts. Provisioning looks like this. The loginwindow is locked, and information from the jamf.log is displayed on the lockscreen.<br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="pd_install_chrome" src="http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/pd_install_chrome.png" width="1052" height="853" /><br />If a Mac is enroled via a non-interactive method (Casper Imaging / Recon network scans) or prompt for info is disabled... the Mac may have no provisioning info. The holdingpattern is displayed, and the JSS is queried every 2 minutes.<br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="pd_waiting_provision" src="http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/pd_waiting_provision.png" width="1052" height="853" /><br /><br />This is very beta and the documentation is rough to say the least, but I do encourage you to play with it and provide feedback.<br /><br />Jump on the "deploy" branch here - <a href="https://github.com/patchoo/patchoo/tree/deploy" rel="self">https://github.com/patchoo/patchoo/tree/deploy</a><br /><br />Log issues or jump on the jamfnation thread. <a href="https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/discussion.html?id=11849" rel="self">https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/discussion.html?id=11849</a><br /><br /><br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>0.9941 - Autopkg + JSS + Patchoo&#x21;  &#x26; No more Mr. Nice Admin</title><dc:creator>Lachlan Stewart</dc:creator><dc:subject>home</dc:subject><dc:date>2014-07-25T10:11:50+10:00</dc:date><link>http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/patchoo-v9941.html#unique-entry-id-7</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/patchoo-v9941.html#unique-entry-id-7</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<br /><h2>AutoPKG + JSS-autopkg-addon + Patchoo</h2><br /><br />The holy grail of Casper software deployment?<br /><br />If you don't know how cool <a href="https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg" rel="self">AutoPKG</a> is, <a href="https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/wiki/Getting-Started" rel="self">you best get acquainted</a>. In a nutshell, it will follow a recipe -  check, download and repackage software for you, and with the very recent addition of a <a href="https://github.com/lindegroup/autopkgr" rel="self">GUI</a> it will do it at the touch of a button!<br /><br />I am yet to get my hands dirty with the way it all works myself, but <a href="https://github.com/arubdesu" rel="self">Allister Banks</a> has built a processor for AutoPKG that every JAMF admin should be very excited about.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/arubdesu/jss-autopkg-addon" rel="self">JSS-autopkg-addon</a> effectively takes freshly built pkgs from autopkg, loads them onto your CDP and then creates the necessary smart groups and policies required for distribution. Cool beans! There has been a <a href="https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/discussion.html?id=10961" rel="self">bit of talk on JAMF Nation and various channels</a> about some of the shortcomings of Casper software deployment, that it's far too admin heavy. Automating a lot of the tedium around policy and smart group creation will go along way to solving this until JAMF revamps it's software deployment tools.<br /><br /><a href="https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/discussion.html?id=9379" rel="self">Calum Hunter has modified</a> the <a href="https://github.com/hunty1/jss-autopkg-addon/blob/master/JSSImporter.py" rel="self">policy and smart group template that JSS-autopkg-addon</a> uses, and it can now dump these freshly created flat pkgs into your patchoo-dev track 100% ready for testing and deployment!<br /><br /><ol class="arabic-numbers"><li>AutoPKG recipe runs.</li><li>Go to your dev/testing Mac client and start a Patchoo run click "Check for Updates" in Self Service.</li><li>Test deployment and app function.</li><li>Move update to beta.</li><li>Move update to production.</li></ol><br />A huge thanks to all the AutoPKG gang, all the Patchoo users and the entire Mac Admin community. We are all doing and ever more importantly, sharing some awesome work!  We are the pirates taking over enterprise IT!<br /><br /><br /><h2>Nasty Mode</h2><br /><br />No more Mr. Nice Admin!<br /><br />Until now, Patchoo has <em>pseudo</em> forced installations once the defer counter expired. There was only one button, but by design I didn't want a timeout to logout and install if a Mac was unattended.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in this day and age of modern client management, those tricky users will find a loophole and do their darndest to not install software patches. We have a few users that are deliberately ignoring the all installations prompts. Catching them in the PatchooDeferCount10+ group and sending reminder emails from the JSS worked, sometimes, but at some sites I had to engage support technicians to physically walk to desks and talk with users. That's not a great use of anyone's time.<br /><br />But in the end, it's too much admin work and there will always be people that don't have the 5 minutes a month it takes to patch their systems. Well, no more....<br /><br /><strong>nastymode=true</strong><br /><br />When enabled (default), if the final forced update prompt is ignored, users are forcibly logged out and patches are installed. Users ARE allowed to save work and will be prompted. Stuck apps will pause the logout process, but it's persistent and will keep quitting apps until users are logged out.<br /><br />If you are in the same situation, addressing the issue as a security and compliance matter is the best way to allay complaints. We are a public US company and must comply with SOX, even if it sometimes can be slightly inconvenient for our staff.<br /><br />Get the <a href="https://github.com/patchoo/patchoo" rel="self">latest commit</a><br /><br /><br /><h2>Licensing</h2><br /><br />You'll also notice a long overdue license file in the repo as well. Patchoo is released under Apache 2.0.<br /><br />I'm no fancy big city lawyer, but this pretty much means you can use it how you want. I've had some great interest and been surprised at some of the really cool companies that are using it (most I can't mention unfortunately). Hopefully this means a few more with more stringent legal requirements can use it too!<br /><br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="vlcsnap-331509" src="http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/vlcsnap-331509.png" width="230" height="172" /><br /><br />If you'd like to contribute please feel free to reach out, or get on Github and submit pull requests!<br /><br />]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>0.994 - fixes &#x26; major OSX Upgrades</title><dc:creator>Lachlan Stewart</dc:creator><dc:subject>home</dc:subject><dc:date>2014-07-08T10:09:47+10:00</dc:date><link>http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/patchoo-v994.html#unique-entry-id-6</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/patchoo-v994.html#unique-entry-id-6</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://github.com/patchoo/patchoo/commit/97df950c7b708df02feb9b456a69f5ceb9fc0903" rel="self">Patchoo 0.944 has been pushed</a> and fixes handling of zipped pkg bundles on Casper 9. I've only recently migrated to the new 9 format (don't ask) and there was a bug when looking up zipped pkg <a href="https://github.com/patchoo/patchoo/blob/master/docs/upload_pkg.md" rel="self">friendly names</a> in the JSS.<br /><br />Changes in this release:<br /><br /><ul class="disc"><li>correctly handle and lookup zipped pkg bundle info from the JSS.</li><li>improvements in OSX upgrades using <a href="https://code.google.com/p/munki/downloads/detail?name=createOSXinstallPkg_20131007.zip" rel="self">createOSXInstallPKG</a></li><li>fixed a small UI discrepancy in the OSX upgrade prompts</li><li>quoted api credentials handle special chars in passwords.</li></ul><br />Did you know you can perform major OSX upgrades via Patchoo? By using <a href="https://code.google.com/p/munki/downloads/detail?name=createOSXinstallPkg_20131007.zip" rel="self">createOSXInstallPKG</a> and patchoo you can provide <em>as convenient admin hands-off</em> major OSX upgrade deployment to 10.9 (or 10.10) via Casper.<br /><br /><br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="Screen Shot 2014-07-07 at 11.35.44 am" src="http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/screen-shot-2014-07-07-at-11.35.44-am.png" width="588" height="398" /><br /><br />Here's a great tip!<br /><br />Use a smart group to scope your deployment, and utilise nested groups to release it to clients as you require. Some organisations may have legacy enterprise software which may not be supported by the latest release of OSX. Instead of doing a blanket upgrade to all clients you can do the following:<br /><br />Scope the patchoo requirements like so:<br /><br />Cached Pkg does not have:<strong> OSXInstall10.9.3.pkg.zip</strong><br />OS is not like, 10.6,10.9, 10.10<br /><br />And then you can setup a static computer group (update10.9-manual) to add Macs you wish to upgrade to.<br /><br />Group them in ( ) with OR, and you can add an entire department or office smart group to deploy Mavericks (or Yosemite) to a all computers <em>without</em> further admin interaction.<br /><br />Once they are scoped correctly (make sure you check!), you might like to send an email direct from the JSS advising users of the impending upgrade and what to expect. Don't have your JSS populated with your user's directory information and email addresses? Don't worry, <a href="https://github.com/loceee/OSXCasperScripts/blob/master/superrecon.sh" rel="self">I can help there too</a>.<br /><br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="Screen Shot 2014-07-08 at 10.19.15 am" src="http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/screen-shot-2014-07-08-at-10.19.15-am.png" width="490" height="339" /><br /><br />Users receive updates in the same way they usually do, but are prompted additionally that the update requires AC power and will take up to 90 minutes.<br /><br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="warning_osx_prompt" src="http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/warning_osx_prompt.png" width="368" height="226" /><img class="imageStyle" alt="warning_osx_2" src="http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/warning_osx_2.png" width="368" height="226" /><br /><br /><br />For more information please read the documentation here. <a href="https://github.com/patchoo/patchoo/blob/master/docs/deploying_major_osx_upgrades.md" rel="self">Deploying Major OSX Upgrades</a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mavericks &#x26; Yosemite Yup&#x21;</title><dc:creator>Lachlan Stewart</dc:creator><dc:subject>home</dc:subject><dc:date>2014-06-17T16:05:08+10:00</dc:date><link>http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/patchoo-v9931.html#unique-entry-id-5</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/patchoo-v9931.html#unique-entry-id-5</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[<br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="images" src="http://www.rehrehreh.com/files/images.jpeg" width="187" height="270" /><br /><br />I love <a href="http://mstratman.github.io/cocoadialog/" rel="self">cocoaDialog</a>, but it seems that Mavericks and Yosemite don't as much. It was always going to be a risk, relying on software that's been stagnating for 2 years without an update... if I had the smarts I'd pick it up, but I don't.<br /><br />Until someone can take cocoaDialog and update it for Mavericks new security features... (<a href="https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/discussion.html?id=10636#responseChild60938" rel="self">as stated by Greg Neagle</a> - apps need to do very specific things to be allowed to play outside of a logged in user session in 10.9+) ... I've  shoehorned a workaround, which whilst not terribly elegant, it does the job.<br /><br />Patchoo 0.9931 - <a href="https://github.com/patchoo/patchoo" rel="self">https://github.com/patchoo/patchoo</a><br /><br />It performs a <em>fauxLogout</em> by quitting all apps (this will break [x] Reopen on Login), then uses the ARD framework's LockScreen to prevent user interaction. It also tweaks cocoaDialog LSUIEelement and LSUIPresentation mode for the install run. This hides the Dock and Menu bar.
